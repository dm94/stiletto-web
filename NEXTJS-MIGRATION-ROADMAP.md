## Route Optimization Strategies

Each rendering strategy requires specific optimization techniques to maximize performance. This section outlines optimization strategies for each route type.

### SSG Routes (Static Site Generation)

| Route | Optimization Strategies |
|-------|------------------------|
| `/` (Home) | - Preload critical assets with `<link rel="preload">` <br> - Implement font optimization with `next/font` <br> - Use image placeholders for faster perceived loading <br> - Implement progressive hydration |
| `/privacy` | - Minimize JavaScript with mostly static content <br> - Implement content security policy <br> - Use static image optimization |
| `/others` | - Share static components across routes <br> - Implement code splitting for any interactive elements |
| `/not-found` | - Keep bundle size minimal <br> - Optimize for Core Web Vitals |

**Implementation Tips:**
- Use `next/image` with proper sizing and formats (WebP/AVIF)
- Implement route-based code splitting
- Set appropriate cache headers (Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable)
- Use `next/script` with strategy="afterInteractive" for non-critical scripts
- Analyze and remove unused CSS/JS with bundle analyzer

### SSR Routes (Server-Side Rendering)

| Route | Optimization Strategies |
|-------|------------------------|
| `/clanlist` | - Implement streaming SSR <br> - Use React Suspense for data loading <br> - Optimize database queries <br> - Implement stale-while-revalidate caching |
| `/trades` | - Implement edge caching with short TTL <br> - Use SWR for client-side updates <br> - Optimize for largest contentful paint |
| `/auctions` | - Implement real-time updates with WebSockets <br> - Use optimistic UI updates <br> - Implement skeleton loading states |

**Implementation Tips:**
- Use `fetchCache` and `revalidate` options in fetch requests
- Implement React Server Components for data-heavy parts
- Use edge functions for geographically distributed rendering
- Implement HTTP/2 Server Push for critical resources
- Use `next/dynamic` with `ssr: false` for non-critical components

### ISR Routes (Incremental Static Regeneration)

| Route | Optimization Strategies |
|-------|------------------------|
| `/tech/:tree` | - Set optimal revalidation intervals (e.g., 1 hour) <br> - Implement on-demand revalidation for content updates <br> - Use shared layouts for faster navigation between trees |
| `/tech/` | - Implement data prefetching for linked tech trees <br> - Use SVG for tech tree visualization <br> - Optimize for interaction to next paint |

<Route path="/wiki/" element={<Wiki />} />

// Next.js: app/[locale]/wiki/page.tsx
export default function WikiPage() {
  // Server component code
}
```

Routing implementation details:
- Replace BrowserRouter with Next.js App Router
- Convert all routes in src/router.tsx to file-based routes
- Implement dynamic routes with square brackets (e.g., [id])
- Set up catch-all routes for fallback pages
- Create not-found.tsx for 404 handling

### State Management

Separate client and server state:

- Use React Server Components for data fetching and rendering
- Use Client Components for interactive elements
- Consider using React Context or a state management library for complex state

State management implementation details:
- Create dedicated Client Components for interactive UI elements
- Implement "use client" directive for components with client-side state
- Migrate existing state management patterns:
  - Local component state: Keep as-is with useState/useReducer
  - Shared state: Implement React Context providers
  - Complex state: Consider Zustand or Jotai for lightweight state management
- Separate data fetching from UI state management
- Implement proper loading and error states

## Challenges and Considerations

1. **Authentication**: âœ… Migrated Discord authentication integration
2. **Interactive Maps**: âœ… Ensured Leaflet integration works with SSR
3. **Data Caching**: âœ… Implemented efficient caching strategies for API data
4. **Bundle Size**: ðŸ”„ Monitoring and optimizing bundle size during migration
5. **SEO**: âœ… Ensured proper metadata for all pages

## Conclusion

Migrating to Next.js will provide significant benefits for the Stiletto Web application, including improved SEO, performance, and developer experience. By following this roadmap and implementing the appropriate rendering strategies for each route, the migration can be completed systematically while maintaining all existing functionality.
