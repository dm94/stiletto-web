# Next.js Migration Roadmap for Stiletto Web

This document outlines the strategy for migrating the Stiletto Web application from its current React/Vite setup to Next.js. The roadmap includes rendering strategies for each route, migration steps, and architecture recommendations. This migration will enhance SEO, performance, and developer experience while maintaining all existing functionality.

## Current Architecture Overview

The current application is:
- Built with React 19.1.0
- Using react-router for client-side routing
- Bundled with Vite
- Using i18next for internationalization
- Styled with Tailwind CSS
- Fetching data from GitHub raw content and custom API endpoints

## Migration Benefits

- **Improved SEO**: Server-side rendering for better search engine visibility
- **Performance**: Faster initial page loads with server rendering and automatic code splitting
- **Built-in API Routes**: Simplify backend communication with API routes
- **Image Optimization**: Automatic image optimization with next/image
- **Internationalization**: Built-in i18n routing support
- **Static Generation**: Generate static pages where appropriate for maximum performance

## Rendering Strategy by Route

| Route | Rendering Strategy | Implementation Status | Rationale |
|-------|-------------------|----------------------|------------|
| `/` (Home) | **SSG** | âœ… Completed | Static content that rarely changes; can be revalidated periodically |
| `/profile` | **CSR** | ðŸ”„ In Progress | User-specific content that requires client-side authentication |
| `/crafter` | **CSR** | âœ… Completed | Calculator with interactive UI requiring client-side state management |
| `/members` | **CSR** | ðŸ”„ In Progress | Dynamic user data that requires authentication |
| `/clanlist` | **SSR** | ðŸ”„ In Progress | Dynamic data that benefits from SEO; changes frequently |
| `/walkerlist` | **ISR** | ðŸ”„ In Progress | Semi-static data that updates occasionally |
| `/maps` | **CSR** | âœ… Completed | Interactive map with client-side state management |
| `/trades` | **SSR** | ðŸ”„ In Progress | Dynamic trade data that benefits from SEO |
| `/diplomacy` | **CSR** | ðŸ”„ In Progress | Interactive UI with authenticated user data |
| `/auctions` | **SSR** | ðŸ”„ In Progress | Time-sensitive data that needs to be current |
| `/others` | **SSG** | ðŸ”„ In Progress | Static utility pages |
| `/map/:id` | **CSR** | âœ… Completed | Interactive map with client-side state management |
| `/map` | **CSR** | âœ… Completed | Map creation interface with client-side state |
| `/tech/:tree` | **ISR** | ðŸ”„ In Progress | Tech tree data that changes infrequently |
| `/tech/` | **ISR** | ðŸ”„ In Progress | Tech tree overview that changes infrequently |
| `/privacy` | **SSG** | âœ… Completed | Static content |
| `/item/:name` | **ISR** | ðŸ”„ In Progress | Item details that change infrequently; benefits from SEO |
| `/wiki/` | **ISR** | ðŸ”„ In Progress | Wiki content that changes occasionally; benefits from SEO |
| `/not-found` | **SSG** | âœ… Completed | Static error page |

**Legend:**
- **SSR**: Server-Side Rendering - Generates HTML on each request
- **SSG**: Static Site Generation - Pre-renders at build time
- **ISR**: Incremental Static Regeneration - Static generation with revalidation
- **CSR**: Client-Side Rendering - Renders in the browser

## Architecture Changes

### Routing

Migrate from react-router to Next.js App Router:

```typescript
// Current: src/router.tsx with react-router
<Route path="/wiki/" element={<Wiki />} />

// Next.js: app/[locale]/wiki/page.tsx
export default function WikiPage() {
  // Server component code
}
```

Routing implementation details:
- Replace BrowserRouter with Next.js App Router
- Convert all routes in src/router.tsx to file-based routes
- Implement dynamic routes with square brackets (e.g., [id])
- Set up catch-all routes for fallback pages
- Create not-found.tsx for 404 handling

### State Management

Separate client and server state:

- Use React Server Components for data fetching and rendering
- Use Client Components for interactive elements
- Consider using React Context or a state management library for complex state

State management implementation details:
- Create dedicated Client Components for interactive UI elements
- Implement "use client" directive for components with client-side state
- Migrate existing state management patterns:
  - Local component state: Keep as-is with useState/useReducer
  - Shared state: Implement React Context providers
  - Complex state: Consider Zustand or Jotai for lightweight state management
- Separate data fetching from UI state management
- Implement proper loading and error states

## Challenges and Considerations

1. **Authentication**: Migrate Discord authentication to Next.js Auth.js
2. **Interactive Maps**: Ensure Leaflet integration works with SSR
3. **Data Caching**: Implement efficient caching strategies for API data
4. **Bundle Size**: Monitor and optimize bundle size during migration
5. **SEO**: Ensure proper metadata for all pages

## Conclusion

Migrating to Next.js will provide significant benefits for the Stiletto Web application, including improved SEO, performance, and developer experience. By following this roadmap and implementing the appropriate rendering strategies for each route, the migration can be completed systematically while maintaining all existing functionality.
